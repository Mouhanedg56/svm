# svm - exploring Support Vector Machines
In this project I will:
* Tune an SVM to fit multiple "standard" datasets to explore kernels
* Classify image data with an SVM
* Preprocess that image data using a convolution.
```
To get started, take a look at this final Jupyter Notebook "miniproject_SVMs_withcomments.ipynb".
